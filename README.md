## Clap Workbench
<div>
A host for CLAP plugins made with Qt and QML. Very much in an early alpha stage, but it can already load plugins in its
channel strip, show either native or generic interfaces on both the main or floating windows, bypass, remove, replace 
and reorder plugins in the strip, as well as save and load sessions.
